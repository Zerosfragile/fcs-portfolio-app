# Visualizing Dynamic Matrix Transformations with Responsive Rendering

## Modules

Modules in this context refer to distinct components of the program that perform specific functions. In this program, we have three main modules: the `Ascii Renderer` module, the `Matrix Handler` module, and the `Animation Sequencer` module. Each module has its own unique responsibilities and is designed to work seamlessly with the other modules to produce the final result.

### Ascii Renderer

This module is responsible for creating and updating the HTML elements that display the ASCII animation on the web page.

- The rendering module includes functions to create and update the HTML elements that display the ASCII animation on the web page.

- It uses the ASCII matrix generated by the matrix module to create the HTML elements.

- The rendering module may also include functions to handle user input, such as clicking the "Replay" button.

### Matrix Handler

This module represents the matrix of characters that make up the ASCII animation. It includes functions to create and update the matrix.

- The matrix module includes functions to create and update the matrix of characters that make up the ASCII animation.

- It may include functions to generate the matrix based on input parameters, such as the heightmap.

- The matrix module may also include functions to update the matrix based on changes to the font size or other parameters.

### Animation Sequencer

This module is responsible for generating the ASCII animation based on the input parameters (e.g., speed, matrix, frame).

- The animation module is responsible for generating the ASCII animation based on input parameters, such as speed and current frame.

- It may include functions to generate specific animations, such as the whirlpool animation.

- The animation module may also include functions to update the animation based on changes to input parameters.

## Problems

Responsive Rendering

- Requires Matrix to be updated with new Dimensions
- Requires Knowledge of current animation and it's state

General

- Use consistent function declaration styles. Either use async function or const function.
- Declare viewBoxDimensions as a local variable inside setViewBox() to avoid relying on global state.
- Consider using const instead of let when declaring variables that won't be reassigned.
- Avoid using setAttribute() and instead set attributes using dot notation. For example, instead of textEl.setAttribute('x', '50%'), use textEl.x = '50%'.
- Consider using template literals instead of string concatenation. For example, instead of 'fill', '#8b8a87', use 'fill': #${color}``.
- Consider using descriptive variable names instead of short ones. For example, instead of numLines, use numberOfLines.
- Add error handling to the async function to handle rejected promises and unexpected errors.
- Consider extracting some of the repeated code into reusable functions to reduce duplication and improve readability.

## Current Modules

### Initialization

This module updates the ASCII port dimensions and creates an ASCII matrix based on the current dimensions of the card element. It calculates the number of lines that can fit in the card element based on the font size, creates the lines in the ASCII port, and stores them in an array in the asciiPort object. The ASCII matrix is stored in a global variable and the AsciiAnimate() function is called to start the animation.

- Get the current dimensions of the card element using `getBoundingClientRect()`.
- Update the `viewBox` attribute of the ASCII port to match the current dimensions of the card element.
- Calculate the number of lines that can fit in the card element based on the font size.
- Update the ASCII port dimensions based on the font size and number of lines.
- Create the lines in the ASCII port based on the current number of lines.
- Store the lines in the ASCII port in an array in the `asciiPort` object.
- Create the ASCII matrix based on the current dimensions of the ASCII port.
- Store the ASCII matrix in a global variable.
- Call the `AsciiAnimate()` function to start the animation.

### Animation

- Update the font size to a larger value.
- Call the `animateDensity()` function to animate the density map.
- Call the `animateWhirlpool()` function to animate the whirlpool effect.
- Update the font size back to the original value.
- Call the `animateDensity()` function again to revert the density animation.
- Call the `animateWhirlpool()` function again to revert the whirlpool animation.

The `animateDensity()` and `animateWhirlpool()` functions themselves are responsible for generating the actual animation of the ASCII matrix, and `AsciiAnimate()` simply calls them in a specific sequence to achieve the desired effect.

### Render

- Loop through each row in the ASCII matrix.
- Convert each row of values in the ASCII matrix to a string of ASCII characters using the `asciiMap` array.
- Set the `innerHTML` property of the corresponding SVG `<text>` element to the string of ASCII characters. The SVG `<text>` elements were created in the initialization function and stored in the asciiPort object.
- The result is that the ASCII animation is displayed in the web page, with each row of the matrix displayed as a line of ASCII characters in the SVG `<text>` elements.
- The render function is responsible for updating the HTML elements with the current state of the ASCII matrix.
- When the render function is called, it first checks if the necessary HTML elements exist in the DOM.
- If the HTML elements don't exist, the render function creates them and appends them to the appropriate parent elements.
- Once the HTML elements have been created or retrieved, the render function updates their contents to match the current state of the ASCII matrix.
- The render function should be called by the animation function every time the matrix is updated, to ensure that the HTML elements stay in sync with the matrix.
- By having the render function handle the creation of the HTML elements, you can ensure that the elements always exist when they're needed, and that they're properly initialized with the correct styles and attributes. This can help to reduce bugs and make the code more reliable and maintainable.
