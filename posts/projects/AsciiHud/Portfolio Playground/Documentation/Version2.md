# Potential Improvements for Application Version 2

## Boosting Performance with Multi-threading

Currently, our application clones variables between threads using the web workers API, which can cause performance bottlenecks. To improve the performance further, we can optimize the way variables are passed between threads by instead passing the memory address of the variable. Additionally, we can leverage typed arrays to further optimize the process.

By using typed arrays, we can efficiently store and manipulate binary data, which is particularly useful for complex computations that involve large datasets. This approach can significantly reduce memory usage and improve the application's overall performance.

To implement this approach, we can use JavaScript to create typed arrays and pass them between threads using the dedicated postMessage() method. By passing the memory address of the variable instead of cloning it, we can reduce the overhead and improve the performance of our application.

Overall, this approach provides a more efficient way to leverage multi-threading and improve the performance of our application. By using typed arrays and passing memory addresses instead of cloning variables, we can reduce the overhead and optimize the performance of our application's multi-threaded operations.

## Enhancing Site-wide Functionality with DOM Coordinate-based Transformations

To improve the site-wide functionality, we can capture the coordinate positions of text elements and use the font size to determine the coordinate positions of every character on the web page. We can then leverage this data to simulate matrix transformations by manipulating only the characters.

The advantage of using this approach is that it does not require structured elements to display the effect. By using coordinates, we can accommodate any offset that may exist and apply the effect to any text on the page, even if it's not part of a specific element.

To achieve this, we can use JavaScript to obtain the coordinates and font sizes of text elements and use them to calculate the positions of individual characters. We can then use this information to simulate matrix transformations and apply the effect to the characters.

This approach provides a more flexible and adaptable way to add site-wide functionality, and it's particularly useful in cases where structured elements are not present.
