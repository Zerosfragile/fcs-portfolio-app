# System Animation

## Current Issues

1. Not adaptable to the dynamically changing container dimensions
2. Doesn't handle sites or adapt to its height, it also reveals downwards instead of upwards.
3. OnMouseLeave doesn't work because the z index on the div is -10, below all the other elements. However, changing it to 0 doesn't work, as it goes above the buttons.

I'm currently unsure about what to do, or the general next steps.
