# TODO

Detailed breakdown of todo tasks:

1. **Cleanup Code**:

   - Remove any commented out code that is not needed.
   - Remove any unused imports.
   - Remove any unused variables and functions.
   - Replace magic numbers/strings with appropriately named constants.
   - Eliminate any code duplication by extracting shared functionality into separate functions.
   - Refactor complex conditions into readable code.

2. **OnClick Events for Links**:

   - Add `onClick` event handlers for all links.
   - Ensure the proper route or function is triggered on the click event.
   - Handle edge cases when there is no valid route or function.
   - Test all click events to ensure correct behavior.

3. **OnClick Events for Buttons**:

   - Add `onClick` event handlers for all buttons.
   - Ensure the proper state changes or function calls are triggered on click events.
   - Add logic to handle edge cases when there is no valid state change or function to call.
   - Test all button click events to ensure correct behavior.

4. **Clean up - Variables**:

   - Rename ambiguous or non-descriptive variables.
   - Replace `var` with `const` or `let` where applicable.
   - Use meaningful and context-relevant variable names.
   - Group related variables together.

5. **HandleMouseEnter Guard Clauses**:

   - Add guard clauses at the beginning of `handleMouseEnter` to handle invalid or unexpected inputs.
   - Ensure the component doesn't break if `btn` or `sites` are `null` or `undefined`.
   - Test the `handleMouseEnter` function with a variety of inputs to ensure robustness.

6. **Rename Variables**:

   - Rename any non-descriptive or ambiguous variable names to be more specific and self-explanatory.
   - Use consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase.
   - Ensure variable names accurately reflect the data they represent.

7. **Encapsulate Logic**:

   - Extract complex logic into separate functions for readability and maintainability.
   - Ensure each function does one thing and does it well (Single Responsibility Principle).
   - Test these new functions to ensure they work as expected.

8. **Revise Types + Type Exports?**:

   - Review all existing TypeScript types and interfaces.
   - Update any types that are missing properties or have incorrect property types.
   - Extract complex types into separate TypeScript interfaces or types.
   - Export types and interfaces that are reused in multiple components.

9. **Typing Animation Reset State?**:

   - Add logic to reset the typing animation's state when necessary.
   - Determine when the typing animation should reset (on component unmount, on specific events, etc.).
   - Test the reset functionality to ensure the typing animation behaves as expected.

10. **React Best Practices and SOLID Principles**:
    - Ensure components follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
    - Use the Open-Closed Principle to allow for extension of components without modifying them.
    - Ensure each component has a well-defined interface.
    - Use composition over inheritance.
    - Move state up to the lowest common parent where it's needed (lifting state up).
    - Keep components as pure functions where possible.

Remember, this list might need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of your project and the current state of your code.
