# RingRuru - Portfolio Project Overview

## Introduction

A mobile-responsive, one-page website created to enhance the brand visibility of the [YouTube channel RingRuru](https://www.youtube.com/@RingRuru). Designed with a y2k theme, the website targets existing fans, subscribers, and prospective viewers.

## Development Timeline

The initial build was completed in approximately 1.5 weeks. Ongoing discussions with the client for potential feature additions and hosting options continue.

### Phase 1: Initial Consultation

Within the first 48 hours, I engaged in preliminary discussions with the client, Mari, to outline the project's scope and structure. Utilizing available public brand assets, I created an initial concept board and project proposal.

### Phase 2: Ideation and Refinement

The proposal intrigued Mari, leading to further discussions about feasibility and alignment with her brand vision. Key considerations included aesthetic preferences and thematic consistency. To ensure we were in sync, we created an aesthetic board and refined the concept board.

- **Aesthetic Board:** Useful for aligning on visual style and brand essence.

### Phase 3: Prototyping and Feedback

Once aligned, I prototyped initial components, iteratively gathering feedback. The preliminary version was hosted on Vercel for client-side testing. During this phase, the focus was on modular design, fine-grained control, and cross-platform compatibility.

### Final Revision

Post-feedback, the website underwent final adjustments, including the integration of analytics and logging services. The client was given frontend editing capabilities for content links, and the site was made publicly accessible at [ringruru.com](https://www.ringruru.com).
