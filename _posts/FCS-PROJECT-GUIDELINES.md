What makes good a good project documentation? 

Most people looking at these posts quite frankly don't care about the projects, they're either here to see what I can do or to learn something new.

As such each project file should answer the following questions:

1. **Context**
	- Why does this exist? 
	- What is the aim of the app
	- Is this a commission, learning project, or fully published project?
	-  When was this made and at what point in my journey 
2. **Introduction** 
	- What tools and technologies did you use
	- What was my role in the project
	- Inspiration / research -> rational for project
3. **Project Specifications**
	- List of features with videos
	- List of embedded interactive components
	- Lists of hooks / utilities used
	- List of any other packages
4. **Visit Project / Project Sunset**
	- A btn to visit the live project, or if the project is sunset, explain why.
