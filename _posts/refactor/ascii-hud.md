# ASCII-HUD: Visualizing Dynamic Matrix Transformations with Responsive Rendering

## I. Context

This system was made as an experiment in the exploration of matrix transformations, computer graphics and chadri patterns. I used this project as an educational tool to limit test dynamic elements in JavaScript and to explore many different patterns such as caching, web workers, canvas, animation frames, and more. Being my first project written in java script, I'm quite proud of the ambition, outcome and most importantly, the lessons I learned during my time working on this.
